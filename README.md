#EVITE Event App
====================
This was based off of our Phase 2 assessment in which we were challenged to build a full CRUD app, built on Sinatra with AJAX features. I added some additional styling (although it needs work), Gravatar images, and the beginnings of some Google Maps API integration. I worked on this on and off for two days.

To Run (I recommend NOT running the seed file)
--------------------
```ruby
bundle
rake db:create
rake db:migrate
shotgun
```
